Acretion rate:
Checked the Bh accretion rates, all haloes accrete most of gas particles during a short period of time 
at the beginning of their accrettion history (some until 10 Gyr, most until 7.5 Gyr and one until 5.5)

Average met:
most of the haloes show steady growth with insignificant fluctuations
most of the haloes reach supersolar mettalicities(except of two with Z~~1.2*Zsolar) > 1.8 Zsolar

Met:
some of the galaxies acrete low metallicity gas at the late stages of their lives(m0175, m0204?, m0209, m0305, m0501).
But there is a lack of data at low redshift, so it may occur by chance, since acreted particle metallicities vary a lot.
