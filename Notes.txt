Accretion rate:
Checked the Bh accretion rates, all haloes accrete most of gas particles during a short period of time 
at the beginning of their accretion history (some until 10 Gyr, most until 7.5 Gyr and one until 5.5)

Average Total Met:
most of the haloes show steady growth with insignificant recent fluctuations and wild ones at the begining of accretion.
most of the haloes reach super-solar mettalicities(except of two with Z~~1.2*Zsolar) > 1.8 Zsolar

Met:
some of the galaxies accrete low metallicity gas at the late stages of their lives(m0175, m0204?, m0209, m0305, m0501).
But there is a lack of data at low redshift, so it may occur by chance, since accreted particle metallicities vary a lot.  

Average bin Met:
At the majority of accretions haloes get high metallicity gas
No pattern can be seen in the AvMet-time dependence
But m0305 and m0209 show outstanding behavior in recent times

dMdt-MeanMet diagram:
No clear pattern can be seen.
But for all haloes (with exception of m0209 and m0305) the points on the diagram are mostly in the square [1.5-3]x[0-1.5](Met)x(dM/dt). The square's area is ~= 0.15 of variation square.
For m0300, m0501, m0858, m0908 more than 90% of points lie in this squares.
Events with low-metal particles(met<solar) being accreted always have low accretion rates.

Eddington ratio: 
I can calculate Eddington luminosity using the formulas
http://www-astro.physics.ox.ac.uk/~garret/teaching/lecture7-2012.pdf
No clear pattern. Something resembling linear regression can be seen on some graphs.

To DO:
Viscosity
Eddington ratio connects bolometric luminosity and Eddington luminosity


Fe/Mg:
Graphs show agreement with the prediction of Shin, etall. (2021)
