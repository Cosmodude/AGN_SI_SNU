Checked the Bh accretion rates, all galaxies acrete most of gas particles during a short period of time 
at the beginning of their acrettion history(some before 10 Gyr, most before 7.5 Gyr and one before 5.5)

Average met:
most of the haloes show steady growth with insignificant fluctuations
most of the haloes reach supersolar mettalicities(except of two with Z~~1.2*Zsolar) > 1.8 Zsolar

Met:

some of the galaxies acrete low metallicity gas at the late stages of their lifes(m0175, m0204?, m0209, m0305, m0501).
But there is a lack of data at low redshift, so it may occur by chance, since acreted particle metallicities vary a lot.
